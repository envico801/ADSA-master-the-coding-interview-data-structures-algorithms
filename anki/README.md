## Questions

### 2. Big O

#### C2

Q: What is the official term for Big O?  
A: The official term is Big O asymptomatic analysis. It can tell us how well a problem is solved.

#### C4

Q: What is good code?  
A: Is the code that is:
1.Readable (is your code clean? can others understand your code?)
2.Scalable (when we grow bigger and bigger with our input how much does the algorithm or function slow down?)

#### C5

Q: What is algorithmic efficiency?  
A: The term algorithmic efficiency is used to describe those properties of algorithms that are related to the amount of resources used by the algorithm. Usually referred to as scalability(Big O)

#### C6

Q: What does linear time mean?  
A: Linear time means that it will loop through n items (all input items). Also known as O(n).

#### C7

Q: What does constant time mean?  
A: Constant time means that the number of steps does not depend on the input size. Also known as O(1). Predictability is always good

#### C13

Q: What does the worst-case rule mean?
A: It means that we always worry about the worst case, because when we talk about scalability we can never assume that things are going to go well (you don't know how the input is going to be). When we talk about Big O we always talk about the worst case scenario.
