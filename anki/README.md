## Questions

### 3. Big O

#### C2

Q: What is the official term for Big O?  
A: The official term is Big O asymptomatic analysis. It can tell us how well a problem is solved.

#### C4

Q: What is good code?  
A: Is the code that is:
1.Readable (is your code clean? can others understand your code?)
2.Scalable (when we grow bigger and bigger with our input how much does the algorithm or function slow down?)

#### C5

Q: What is algorithmic efficiency?  
A: The term algorithmic efficiency is used to describe those properties of algorithms that are related to the amount of resources used by the algorithm. Usually referred to as scalability(Big O)

#### C6

Q: What does linear time mean?  
A: If an algorithm is in the order of O(n), or linear time complexity, the number of operations it performs scales in direct proportion to the input.
e.g. (for loops, while loops through n items)

#### C7

Q: What does constant time mean?  
A: Constant time means that the number of steps does not depend on the input size. Also known as O(1). Predictability is always good

#### C13

Q: What does the rule of "worst-case" mean?
A: It means that we always worry about the worst case, because when we talk about scalability we can never assume that things are going to go well (you don't know how the input is going to be). When we talk about Big O we always talk about the worst case scenario.

#### C14

Q: What does the rule of "eliminating constants" mean?
A: As the name says, if Big 0 is the product of multiple terms, constant terms are eliminated (constant terms are like static numbers, numbers like 1, 4, 5, basically anything that is not a variable).
We only care about when it scales, when the size of the input is getting larger and larger.

Q: What is the big O of iterating over half a collection?
A: It ends up being O(n) because if we apply basic mathematics we can transform the division into a multiplication **(n/2 = 1/2 x n)** and then apply the rule of eliminating constants.

#### C15

Q: What does the rule of "different terms for inputs" mean?
A: It means that different notations/variables are used for different inputs, because since we do not know the length of each one, we cannot assume that they are the same.  
1.**O(n) is different from O(a + b)**  
2.**O(n^2) is different from O(a \* b)**

Q: When calculating big O and having steps in order (one below the other), which operation should be used?
A: Addition (+) must be used for steps in order

Q: When calculating large O and having nested steps (a loop within a loop), which operation should be used?
A: Multiplication (\*) must be used for nested steps.

#### C16

Q: What does quadratic time mean?  
A: It means that the number of operations it performs is proportional to the square of the input.
e.g. Every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two
nested loops

#### C17

Q: What does the rule of "drop non dominants" mean?
A: It means that we prioritize the term that has more weight (scale) at the moment of calculating the big O.  
1.**O(n^2+3n+100+n/2) is equal to O(n^2)**

#### C19

Q: What are data structures?
A: They are a way of storing data.  
You could say they are a collection of values and these values can have relationships between them and functions can be applied to them.  
The most important thing is that each data structure is good and specialized in its own thing.

Q: What are algorithms?
A: These are the steps or processes we put in place to manipulate our data structures to write our programs (instructions for our computer).

#### C20

Q: What does factorial time mean?  
A: It means that you are adding a loop for every element  
We will find ourselves writing algorithms with factorial time complexity when calculating permutations and combinations.

#### C21

Q: What are the 3 pillars of good coding?
A: 1.Readable: (clean code) that can be maintained and others can read.
2.Speed: (time complexity) that has a Big O that is efficient, scales well.
3.Memory: (space complexity)

#### C22

Q: What causes Space complexity? **(how much memory or resources it occupies as the input grows)**
A: 1.Variables (assignments and mutability with objects)
2.Data Structures (both custom and native)
3.Function Call (function calls, e.g. a recursive one, which is stored in memory as a stack.)
4.Allocations (when we create variables, functions or anything else that is stored in the memory)

#### C24

Q: What would you say is the Big O in the following sentence?

```javascript
'asdasdljasdk'.length;
```

A: It depends on the language you are working with, we need to know how the method is implemented to be able to give an accurate answer.

#### Extras

Q: What can cause time in a function? **(how long does it take to traverse / solve something as the input grows, how many operations does it have to perform?)**
1.Operations (+, -, \*, /)
2.Comparisons (<, >, ==)
3.Looping (for, while)
4.Outside Function call (function()) (can be a call to a recursive function or to a regular function.)

Q: List the common Big O complexities from worst to best (there are 7)  
A: O(n!)  
O(2^n)  
O(n^2)  
O(n log n)  
O(n)  
O(log n)  
O(1)

Q: Space complexity is not concerned with the size of the input per se but the...  
A: ...memory that is being allocated for each operation.

### 4. How To Solve Coding Problems

#### C2

Q: What skills does the interviewer look for?
A: 1.Analytic Skills - How can you think through problems and analyze things?  
2.Coding Skills - Do you code well, by writing clean, simple, organized, readable code?  
3.Technical knowledge - Do you know the fundamentals of the job you're applying for?  
4.Communication skills: Does your personality match the companiesâ€™ culture?

### 5. Data Structures: Introduction

#### C3

Q: What is RAM used for?  
A: RAM is used for immediate data storage and retrieval

Q: What is a memory address?  
A: It is a reference to a specific memory location

Q: What is a bit (binary digit)?  
A: A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store.  
A bit is always in one of two physical states, similar to an on/off light switch. The state is represented by a single binary value, usually a 0 or 1.

Q: What is a byte?  
A: A byte is a sequence of 8 bits that are treated as a single unit.

Q: What is a memory controller?  
A: A memory controller is a device that manages the data flow between the CPU and system RAM.  
The memory controller acts as the middleman in these operations, ensuring that the proper information is retrieved from the right locations.  
**The closer the information is to the CPU and the less it has to travel, the faster a program can be executed.**

Q: What is CPU cache?  
A: It is a cache memory that is used to reduce the average memory access time.  
**It's like a mini RAM integrated in the CPU.**

Q: Why is it said that there are no integers in JavaScript?  
A: There is only the [Number](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type) data type in JS that represents numbers.  
**Internally it is implemented as [IEEE 754](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-terms-and-definitions-number-value) double precision floating point number.**  
What it means is that - technically there is no dedicated data type that represents integer numbers.  
Practically it means that we can safely use only numbers that are safely representable by the aforementioned standard. And it includes integer values in the range: `[-9007199254740991; 9007199254740991]`. Both values are defined as constants: [`Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-number.min_safe_integer) and [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-number.max_safe_integer) correspondingly.

#### C5

Q: What are the actions that can be performed on a data structure?
A:
1.Insertion: Add a new data item in a given collection of items
2.Deletion: Delete data from a collection
3.Traversal: Access to each data item exactly once so it can be processed
4.Searching: Find the location of the data item if it exists in a given collection
5.Sorting: Having data that is sorted
6.Access: How do we access this data that we have on our computer

#### Extras

Q: What are the 2 pillars of Data Structures?  
A: How to build one  
How to use one

### 6. Data Structures: Arrays

#### C1

Q: What is an array?
A: An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.

Q: What is the Big O for an Array lookup operation? (aka **access**: Array\[2\])  
A: O(1)

Q: What is the Big O for an Array find operation? (aka **search**: Array.find(callbackFn))  
A: O(1)
e.g. We traverse the entire array to check if an element is present.

Q: What is the Big O of an Array push/append operation? (aka **insertion**: Array.push(value))  
A: O(1) if the array is static  
O(n) if the array is dynamic and has to grow when the new value is added.
**Note that the worst case is still O(n).**

Q: What is the Big O of an Array shift operation? (aka **insertion**: Array.shift(value))  
A: O(n)

Q: What is the Big O of an Array pop operation? (aka **deletion**: Array.pop())  
A: O(1)
**Note that the worst case is still O(n). - (unshift, splice, etc)**

Q: What is the Big O of an Array unshift operation? (aka **deletion**: Array.unshift())  
A: O(n)

#### C2

Q: What are the 2 types of Arrays?  
A: Dynamic and Static

Q: What is a dynamic array?  
A: An array that can grow in size when it needs to. No specification of size is needed when it is initiated.

Q: What is a static array?  
A: A fixed size array. Must specify the size when it is initiated.

#### C5

Q: In JavaScript, what data structure is an Array actually?  
A: An Object which contains properties and methods which make it Array-like.

#### C6

Q: How should we handle questions related to strings?
A: We should treat it as an array question, strings are an array of characters.
e.g. reverse a string.

#### C12

Q: What are the pros of using arrays?
A: 1.Fast lookups (accessing information where you know which index you want to look at)
2.Fast push/pop (adding or removing things at the end of an array)
3.Ordered (having something that is ordered and close to each other in memory makes it really fast)

Q: What are the cons of using arrays?
A: 1.Slow inserts (we have to shift the array when at the very end of the array)
2.Slow deletes (same as inserts)
3.Fixed size\* (sometimes you have to declare the memory ahead of time and how large of an array you want. Most modern languages have dynamic arrays that help with this)

### 7. Data Structures: Hash Tables

#### C1

Q: What are Hash Tables?  
A: **Collections of { Key: Value } pairs**
A Hash table is defined as a data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly. It operates on the [hashing concept](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hashing/), where each key is translated by a hash function into a distinct index in an array. The index functions as a storage location for the matching value. In simple words, it maps the keys with the value. (it will store the key and the value at the same address in memory - a "bucket") `G7xpLLQ4 -> key:value`

#### C2

Q: What is a Hash function?  
A: A function that generates a value of fixed length for each input it receives. For any given input, the output will always be the same.  
Examples:  
Input = Grape  
Output (is always) = G7xpLLQ4  
Input = 5  
Output (is always) = Ax67def0

Q: What does it mean for a function to be "idempotent"?
A: It is a fancy way of saying that a function given an input always outputs the same output

#### C3

Q: What is the Big O for insertion into a Hash Table?  
A: O(1)  
Unless there is a collision, then it would be O(n / k) where k = the length of the address being accessed.

Q: What is the Big O for a lookup (access) in a Hash Table?  
A: O(1)
Unless there is a collision, then it would be O(n / k) where k = the length of the address being accessed.

Q: What is the Big O for deletion in a Hash Table?  
A: O(1)
Unless there is a collision, then it would be O(n / k) where k = the length of the address being accessed.

Q: What is the Big O for a search in a Hash Table?  
A: O(1)
e.g. `object["key"]` It will return if that key is present in the object (undefined otherwise), that's why it is O(1).
Unless there is a collision, then it would be O(n / k) where k = the length of the address being accessed.

Q: What is a collision in regards to a Hash Table?  
A: When a new item is added to the same "address" as an already existing item in a Hash Table.  
This could slow down the lookup for a Hash Table from O(1) to O(n / k) where k = the size of the address being accessed.

#### C4

Q: What kind of _data-type_ is a **Key** in a typical Hash Table?  
A: A String

Q: In ES6, what kind of _data-types_ can a **Key** be for a Map?  
A: Any kind of data-type

Q: In ES6, what kind of Hash Table maintains insertion order?  
A: A Map

Q: Does a Set store values in JavaScript?  
A: No, only Keys which are unique (no two keys can be the same in a Set).

#### C7

Q: Which data-structure is more efficient at looping over data: An Array or a Hash Table?  
A: An Array.  
If your Hash Table has 50 addresses but only 3 addresses contain Keys, you would still have to access all 50 addresses to obtain those Keys.  
An Array is sequential in memory, which makes it more efficient in this regard.

#### C12

Q: What are the pros of using hash tables?
A: 1.Fast lookups\* (Good collision resolution needed, usually we dont need to worry about this because our language underneath the hood take care of that for us)
2.Fast inserts (same as lookups)
3.Flexible keys (depending on the type of hash tables, such as maps, we can have flexibles keys instead of an array that has numbered indexes)

Q: What are the cons of using hash tables?
A: 1.Unordered (its hard to really go through everything in order)
2.Slow key iteration (if i want to grab all the keys from a hash table I will have to go through the entire memory space)

### 8. Data Structures: Linked Lists

#### C1

Q: Can Linked Lists help solve collision issues in a Hash Table?  
A: Yes

#### C2

Q: What is a Linked List?  
A: A collection of nodes and pointers.  
Data is stored in the node itself and a pointer is a reference to the next node in the list.  
The end of a Linked List is signified by a "null" value.

Q: How its called the first node in a linked list?
A: Head.

Q: How its called the last node in a linked list?
A: Tail.
Some people call the tail anything that is after the head.

Q: How do you know that you have reached the end of a Linked List?  
A: Linked Lists are "null-terminated" which means the end of the list is denoted by the value "null".

#### C4

Q: What kind of structure do Linked Lists have?  
A: A 'loose' structure. You can easily insert a new data as you only have to change 2 pointers (depending on if it is singly linked, doubly linked, etc..)

Q: What is the main difference between a Linked List and an Array?  
A: Arrays are indexed, Linked Lists are not.  
If you want to access the 5th element in a Linked List, you have to start from the beginning of the list and traverse to the 5th element.  
In an Array, you can simply access the element at index 4 ( arr\[4\] ) to get the value of the 5th element.

Q: Are nodes in a Linked List stored sequentially in memory?  
A: No. They are scattered over memory which makes traversal of a Linked List slower than traversal of an Array.

Q: Whats one advantage that linked list have over hash tables?
A: That there is some sort of order to link list, each node points to the next node.

Q: What is the Big O for a prepend (add to the beginning of the list) operation on a Linked List/Double link list?  
A: O(1)

Q: What is the Big O of an append (add to the end of the list) operation on a Linked List/Double link list?  
A: O(1)

Q: What is the Big O of a lookup (traversal) operation on a Linked List/Double link list?  
A: O(n)
e.g. We go through the whole linked list to check if an element is present. In the case of a double linked list it would technically be O(n/2) because we can start at both ends and if we know in which half of the list is what we are looking for, we can choose the optimal place to start.

Q: What is the Big O of an insertion operation on a Linked List/Double link list?  
A: O(n)

Q: What is the Big O of a deletion operation on a Linked List/Double link list?  
A: O(n)

#### C5

Q: What is a pointer?  
A: A pointer is a reference to another place in a memory (another node). Kind of like a variable referencing another variable.

#### C14

Q: What does a Doubly Linked List have that a Singly Linked List does not?  
A: A 'previous' pointer which references the node before it. You can traverse forwards and backwards through a Doubly Linked List. You can only traverse forwards in a Singly Linked List.

Q: Does a Doubly Linked List use more memory than a Singly Linked List?  
A: Yes. The 'previous' pointer will require more memory for the Doubly Linked List to be implemented.

#### C17

Q: What are the advantages of a **linked list** over a double linked list?
A: 1.Fairly simple implementation (compared to the double link list)
2.Requires less memory (when we do things like delete and insert because there is technically less operation, we dont have to move around the previous property, its a little bit faster)

Q: What are the disadvantages of a **linked list** over a double linked list?
A: 1.It cannot be iterated in reverse or traverse from back to front (if we ever lose the reference to `this.head` of the list, the list can actually be lost in memory forever)

Q: What are the advantages of a **double linked** list over a linked list?
A: 1.It can be iterated or traversed both from the front or from the back.
2.Easy insert or delete (if you need to delete a previous node, you don't need to traverse from the head node and find what the previous node is)

Q: What are the disadvantages of a **double linked** list over a linked list?
A: 1.Fairly complex (it requires more memory and storage because of this extra property and there are some actual operations that we need to perform to make sure that we when we do insert and delete that the previous property is updated as well).

Q: What are the pros of using linked lists?
A: 1.Fast insertion (if we had a large number of elements in an array and kept adding to that array we would have to have excessive overhead copying the array into memory and doubling the space when it reached the limit to create a larger array. Versus a linked list where we can have fast insertion and fast deletion especially once we have a reference to where we want to insert or delete that node).
2.Fast deletion (same as insertion)
3.Ordered (linked lists allow us to have this sort of order.)
4.Flexible size (this is the primary reason to choose a linked list over something like an array is simplicity and ability to grow and shrink as needed.)

Q: What are the cons of using linked lists?
A: 1.Slow lookup (we have to traverse through the list if we're searching for something.)
2.More memory (we store more properties in memory, in the case of a double linked list we are storing the `value - next - prev`)
